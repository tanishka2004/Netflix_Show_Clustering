✨ Netflix Show Clustering – Data Science Mini Project
Grouping similar Netflix shows using K-Means Clustering based on genre and duration.


📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of unsupervised learning (K-Means) to cluster Netflix shows by their genres and durations. The dataset was cleaned, feature-engineered, encoded, and visualized using Python libraries.


📁 Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Netflix Shows Dataset


🔧 Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy – data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn – data visualization

Scikit-learn – StandardScaler, KMeans


🔄 Workflow
Data Cleaning (removing nulls, simplifying genres, numeric duration extraction)

One-hot Encoding for Genre

Feature Scaling with StandardScaler

Clustering using KMeans (k=5)

Cluster visualization with Matplotlib & PCA


📊 Sample Output
(You can include an image of your cluster plot here)


🧠 Learnings
Applied K-Means Clustering on real-world messy data

Practiced feature engineering and one-hot encoding

Understood how duration and genre affect show grouping

Created interpretable visualizations and cluster summaries
